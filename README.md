This repository includes MATLAB projects that are related with core topics of signal processing such as: 

DFT-Discrete Fournier Transform(**https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~sjrob/Teaching/SP/l7.pdf**)

Amplitude Modulation (AM) which is technique by which the amplitude of the carrier wave is changed according to the signal wave or modulating signal

Frequency Modulation (FM) is a technique in which the frequency of the carrier wave is changed according to the amplitude of the message signal


Also in this repository are included matlab files that concentrates on the study of signals and systems of discrete and continous time in the field of time (with the help of the operation of convolution) and in field of frequencies (by using Continuous Time Fournier Series (CFTS), Discrete Time Fourier Transform (DTFT) and Continuous Time Fourier Transform (CTFT)).

All these MATLAB projects are part of the postgraduate course "ELectronics-Computers-Telecommunications-Automation Laboratory" of the Physics Department of UoA.
