This repository includes MATLAB projects that are related with core topics of signal processing such as: 

[**DFT-Discrete Fournier Transform**](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~sjrob/Teaching/SP/l7.pdf)

Amplitude Modulation (AM) which is technique by which the amplitude of the carrier wave is changed according to the signal wave or modulating signal

Frequency Modulation (FM) is a technique in which the frequency of the carrier wave is changed according to the amplitude of the message signal
